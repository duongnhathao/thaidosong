Sitegound is a good value for money. It is reasonably priced and for website that are not eCommerce related or commercial, it works fine. As you said, problems might come up when you need support because prices are so low that they have to save somewhere and support is one of those things. Not that they have the worst support among shared hosting providers since everyone is struggling with it but you start to understand what you get way paying extra for services like WP Engine another. But if you are hosting a small blog or website that doesn&#039;t generate tons of traffic and revenue then Siteground is a much better option because occasional downtimes are not going to cost you a fortune. 

All in all, if you can afford you should choose WP Engine, Kinsta or similar hosting providers but you will be just fine with Siteground, to begin with, while you grow your business because it is not that bad to be avoided.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job. I love the two recommendations you give: WPENGINE and SITEGROUND.

When I first started off our business I started with WPE and loved them as they are newbies friendly with their support. My only issues was their price as you grow. 

We eventually got to 20 websites and was paying about $4000 dollars a year and that was just too much.
 I love and still recommend them but I believe there are 1 to 2 more hosts with an equal value that are more reasonable price-wise.

We use Siteground now and like their tools and available customer service support.
The only problem I see with Siteground as much as their products are great is that a lot of their support lately has been bad. 

They will respond on time but some of them lack the common sense to read your message to understand what you need before responding. So I have resorted to always asking for senior tech or support as they are way better.

Other than that Siteground is a great choice and we love their price and value.

Good job again.]]></description>

Marco, 

It depends what is your target demographics. For example, I live in Latvia by my main market is in US. Which means that hosting a website in Latvia makes absolutely no sense unless Latvian company also happens to have servers in US. The closest your server is to your target audience the better it will perform. That&#039;s why many large hosting providers allow to choose the location for your server. We are hosted with &lt;a href=&quot;https://colorlib.com/wp/kinsta-review/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kinsta&lt;/a&gt;. They are registered in UK but our hosting is located in US to be close to our main market.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aigars,

Your recommendations are good, particularly WP Engine.

But folk should also consider local providers, that tend not to be covered in articles like these.

I&#039;m in Australia and most of my clients are, so I&#039;ve opted for a local specialist WordPress hosting provider.

I&#039;ve hosted with WP Engine, Site Ground, Site 5, Media Temple and a few more, with mixed results.

But none of these beat WP Hosting in terms of performance and support. When a site is slow I call them up and they will troubleshoot the issue by looking at my plugins, cron jobs, etc... and 9 times out of 10 it&#039;s my fault, lol

The point I&#039;m making here is that, as I said, there are many more options for people when they consider local providers too.]]></description>

Try getting 100,000 visitors to your Bluehost website and you will already see how insanely slow it gets and how often it will be down. 100M is never going to happen under any circumstances. Performance of WP Engine, Kinsta or other managed hosting is also way better than any f shared offerings.]]></description>

At that price range I would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://colorlib.com/out/kinsta&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Kinsta&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://colorlib.com/out/wpengine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;WP Engine&lt;/a&gt;. They have similar offerings but client support is so much better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Aigars,

I have throughly enjoyed reading your informative articles on Colorlib.
I am starting a directory/listing events business based in West Africa. 

I don&#039;t anticipate on making a substantial amount revenue at the beginning. Hence WP Engine&#039;s tiers may become too expensive.

How would you rate the Blue host Managed Wordpress Hosting as i think the plan is cheaper than WP Engine?
Bluehost $19.99 plan allows 100million visits/month.

Or would suggest still starting with WP Engine?

Thanks in advance]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there. This is a very good article and the guide is truly helpful for beginners like me who want to start their own website. From what I&#039;ve seen so far, SiteGround is one of the best website hosts and has a lot of good things to offer. I am thinking of choosing them out of the best website hosts in the business, but I&#039;m also curious about one other website, which is BlueHost.

					<description><![CDATA[Great article! I bet it will be useful to many people. But it’s quite important for everybody to be clear about what their website needs and what’s the best hosting solution for it. If it’s a shared hosting, VPS or maybe dedicated server. It’s a good option to start using hosting services step by step, in accordance with your website growth. I did the same thing and it worked perfectly for me. My website was small at first, it didn’t have many visitors, so I chose a shared hosting, which is probably the most affordable hosting solution (of course, it depends on the hosting provider). When my WordPress website grew bigger I saw that I need a VPS, so I choose one again by BGOcloud. Now my website has a lot more visitors, and who knows, maybe one day I’ll purchase even a dedicated server.]]></description>

John, 

This happens with all cheap shared hosting providers. That&#039;s why we recommend managed WordPress hosting such as one offered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://colorlib.com/out/wpengine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;WP Engine&lt;/a&gt;, Kinsta or Pagely.
