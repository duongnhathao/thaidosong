					<description><![CDATA[You guys are Awesome....Your templates are a big help in learning and enhancing skills.
Just a small observation:
I am new so right now just exploring ideas, and in the process of checking your free
templates I got interested in GLINT-COLORLIB,  but sadly it was not free to download,
was that just an oversight and got listed as free in error.
If not, then could you please reply with a copy of the GLINT template.

Thank you for your help, really appreciate what you provide.
Regards, Navin Gupta]]></description>
