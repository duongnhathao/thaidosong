Well it&#039;s not that easy as it might sound.

Here are values responsible for content layout. First one if sor sidebar and second one one is for content. The main goal here is to get 100% as the result when combining all these values. 
 
&lt;pre&gt;
#secondary {
	margin-left: 3.06%;
	width: 31.28%;
}
#primary {
	margin-left: 3.06%;
	width: 65.64%;
}	
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add them to Theme Options - Other - Custom CSS and start tweaking these values.]]></description>

Ok, I see. That&#039;s my bad since I tested it only via Chrome Development Tools. 

Replace previously given code with this one and see if that works 
&lt;pre&gt;
.back-to-top {
	left: 18px;
	max-width: 40px
}
&lt;/pre&gt;]]></description>

It is possible, however, you will have to use plugin or enable it via functions.php. I guess the simpler method will be to get this done by using plugin. 

Here is one of those plugins which will enable excerpt field for pages: http://wordpress.org/plugins/page-excerpt/]]></description>

I haven&#039;t done so yet, but I will at the moment. Thanks again for your support. People like you doesn&#039;t being born everyday ! Thanks again for the support. 

I have done what you said, but instead of moving the back to top button, it just add width and, I thought that I had done a mistake, so i removed the &quot;doth&quot; before back-to-top, and it just froze the background !]]></description>

This text is called Excerpt and it can be controlled for each Post individually. When editing Posts you will see a field called Excerpt under Post Edit area and this is where you can add your custom text. 
If you can&#039;t see Excerpt field you can enable it via Screen Options on the upper right corner in Post Edit view.]]></description>

Thank you for your outstanding feedback! Glad you like this theme. 

Actually it is very easy to move back to top button from right to left. You just need to add this to Them Options - Other - Custom CSS. 
&lt;pre&gt;
.back-to-top {
	left: 18px;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

I don&#039;t know if you already did but I would highly appreciate if you could rate/review this theme on WordPress.org : http://wordpress.org/support/view/theme-reviews/travelify?filter=5]]></description>

Really I hope you will appreciate the work done with that your theme, whoch I really like.

Thanks again for your help, and for the job you&#039;re doing ! ;)]]></description>

This will be possible only if you are good with CSS/HTML and some PHP since these fonts are not on most devices and you will have to load them from some library such as Google Fonts or add them to theme folder if you have a licence for them.]]></description>

It&#039;s how it should be. I decided to leave users with some freedom since most users don&#039;t want featured images to be visible in Post pages automatically, however you can insert them manually in the post like any other image. Basically you set it once for featured image and then insert the same image in the post with a single upload. 

If I would have left an options for featured images to be visible in Posts, users who don&#039;t like to see these images they would have to do some custom coding. 

I hope you got an idea.]]></description>
