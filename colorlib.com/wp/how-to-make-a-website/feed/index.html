					<description><![CDATA[Hello, 

I´m new to the wordpress but the whole instalation process was pretty easy until I wanted to instal your theme: https://colorlib.com/wp/template/negotiate/

I have downloaded the free version just to try and play if this is realy what I´m looking for before I will pay for the version with the license, unfortunately the instalation has failed with the announcement: This theme is missing the template style.css, I was not able to figure it out as the zip file contain also the css folder. Could you help me out on this?

Thank you]]></description>

If you have ever used free hosting you know that it is a good thing that they don&#039;t have a free plan. That would make a terrible impression of their service. There is never a free hosting that is free at the same time. Because keeping the lights on for a hosting company costs a fortune and to give something away for free you need to have some way to make money and usually, it is by filling your website full of ads and affiliate links.]]></description>

Both can still be used today. Some of our authors have switched to the Gutenberg Block editor but I like to stick with the classic editor. Just because I don&#039;t need any of the new features the new one brings and keeping it simple is always better for me.]]></description>
