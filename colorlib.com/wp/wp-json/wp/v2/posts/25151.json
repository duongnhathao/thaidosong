WordPress is an easy-to-use, reasonably powerful content management system (CMS). A CMS is designed to act as a platform for every type of website, so it has to be a bit general in its approach.&nbsp;Assuming that you can code and add functions to your WordPress database, it still would be quite the hassle.&nbsp;Plugins have been created to solve this particular issue.<\/p>\n<p>While plugins are not tailor-made for a particular website, there are many that cater to specific functions and prove useful to all WordPress websites irrespective of the business niche or the site type. Apart from that, there are niche-specific plugins as well.<\/p>\n<p>Below are plugins that a WordPress site cannot do without.<\/p>\n<h2>What functions do must-have plugins cater to?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#security\">security<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wordpress-backup-plugins\">running site backups<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wordpress-seo-plugins\">search engine optimization (SEO)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#social-sharing-plugins\">social media sharing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wordpress-caching-plugins\">site caching (WordPress performance optimization)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wordpress-contact-forms\">contact forms<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wordpress-spam-protection\">handling spam comments<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\" class=\"post-section\">Security Plugins<\/h2>\n<h3>Wordfence<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25189\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/Wordfence1.png\" alt=\"Wordfence\" width=\"800\" height=\"260\"><\/p>\n<p>Wordfence is an efficient website guard dog. It comes with a firewall, login security measures, and auto-scheduled scanning options. A&nbsp;cloud-powered system, the plugin scans your website (WP database and files) for changes, malicious scripts, or viruses.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also helps keep your website off Google&#8217;s blacklist (GSB). It does so by scanning your entire website for links you may have included, which are part of the GSB or which may then cause your site to land up on the GSB.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin has a basic options panel that can be used by all and an advanced options panel that allows for fine-tuning of plugin performance. This plugin promptly informs you when someone is trying to access your site when they shouldn&#8217;t be able to via email updates. The scanning options are pretty impressive and allow you to check your WP out thoroughly. With the firewall, you can throttle site requests if something seems suspicious. This is useful if you ever have to fend off a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack or brute force (automated password guessing) attacks.<\/p>\n<p>Monitoring live traffic is a breeze despite the fact that it is pretty redundant unless you are on the lookout for something specific in your website&#8217;s traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25190\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/Live-Traffic.png\" alt=\"Live Traffic\" width=\"800\" height=\"487\"><\/p>\n<p>You can block certain countries from accessing your website if you want, too, although I have no clue why someone would do something like that. Apart from the above, you can block IPs and ranges of IP addresses, as well as enable cellphone sign-ins and caching.<\/p>\n<a class=\"nectar-button medium accent-color\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wordfence\/\">More info \/ Download<\/a>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wordfence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The premium version of the plugin<\/a> offers even more in the way of security options.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Jetpack<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-267843\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/jetpack-essential-free-wordpress-plugin.jpg\" alt=\"jetpack essential free wordpress plugin\" width=\"1100\" height=\"479\"><br \/>\nJetpack is an essential free WordPress plugin that helps you take care of your website&#8217;s protection.

If you run a revenue-generating website or if you intend to make your site into one in the near future, then know that time is money. If ever your site goes down for some reason, you&#8217;ll need to get it back up immediately. Every second your site remains offline, you lose revenue. It needs to be backed up on a regular basis with easy restoration options.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one more thing about backups you ought to know. If your host provider offers backup options, find out if their backup servers are separate from their normal servers. If not, then by putting the backup and your site on the servers in the same physical location, it makes your site vulnerable to any physical catastrophe that may cause harm to your host&#8217;s servers. We need the backup in location and on a server entirely independent of your host&#8217;s servers.<\/p>\n<h3>UpdraftPlus<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25211\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/UpdraftPlus.png\" alt=\"UpdraftPlus\" width=\"800\" height=\"260\"><\/p>\n<p>With UpdraftPlus, you can save a copy of your WP and all its contents on a number of different locations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon S3<\/li>\n<li>Dropbox<\/li>\n<li>Google Drive<\/li>\n<li>Rackspace Cloud<\/li>\n<li>FTP &amp; SFTP<\/li>\n<li>Email<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The list goes on.<\/p>\n<p>You can select the backup interval according to your needs. It is best to back up your site at least once a day. The plugin permits only one backup location for the free version of the plugin. If you&#8217;d like to back up your site to more than one location, <a href=\"http:\/\/updraftplus.com\/shop\/morestorage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you&#8217;ll need to add the premium version, which costs $20<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>UpdraftPlus helps back up your plugins, themes, uploads, and other content. You can also run a WP database backup alternately at a different interval from your normal backup. Restoration of both files and database are easy and, in most cases, seamless.<\/p>\n<a class=\"nectar-button medium accent-color\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/updraftplus\/\">More info \/ Download<\/a>\n<h3>BackWPup<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-213742\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/backwpup-essential-free-wordpress-plugin.jpg\" alt=\"backwpup essential free wordpress plugin\" width=\"1100\" height=\"496\"><br \/>\nAs the name suggests, BackWPup is an essential free WordPress plugin for performing backups. As simple as that. With BackWPup, you can save the complete installation to a 3rd-party service like Dropbox, Microsoft Azure, SugarSync or your own FTP server. It gives you a single .zip file which you can later use to restore a backup quickly and effectively. Every so often, it is highly advisable to create a backup especially if you have some hot content going on on your WordPress page that you do not want to lose if something goes wrong. Better be safe than sorry.<\/p>\n<p>To get the gist of it, BackWPup comes with a quick introduction video which will familiarize you with the plugin. Of course, the whole installation and activation process is both fast and straightforward.<\/p>\n<a class=\"nectar-button medium accent-color\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/backwpup\/\">More info \/ Download<\/a>\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-seo-plugins\" class=\"post-section\">Search Engine Optimization<\/h2>\n<p>We receive a healthy chunk of our traffic from Google, so make sure that Google is your ally. A few simple tricks enabled by a plugin will help your site with SEO. Your site will not suffer in any way due to poor search engine optimization.<\/p>\n<h3>WordPress SEO<\/h3>\n<p>WordPress SEO is a great tool for search engine optimization. We use the same on ColorLib.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25216\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/WordPress-SEO.png\" alt=\"WordPress SEO\" width=\"800\" height=\"256\"><\/p>\n<p>It helps with a great number of seemingly small yet cumulatively rather important things.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin helps ensure that the titles, meta data, permalinks, breadcrumbs, RSS feed, your site&#8217;s social accounts, homepage, taxonomies, and archives are in order. You can create an XML sitemap, which is basically a blueprint for your website. This is made available for a search engine&#8217;s crawler to pick up. WordPress SEO prevents the site from encountering any content duplication problems from within your own site. It helps calculate the search engine optimization of each post you publish prior to publication. Yoast&#8217;s plugin helps shows a snippet preview of how your post turns up on a search.<\/p>\n<p>Add an SEO keyword, a title, and a meta description. In the page analysis at the bottom of your page\/post editor, you can view the keyword density, the minimum word count recommendation, the ease of content readability, the number of outbound links, and the social aspects of your content as well.<\/p>\n<a class=\"nectar-button medium accent-color\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wordpress-seo\/\">More info \/ Download<\/a>\n<p>SEO is not the same for all sites. The process can be altered differently for commerce sites, sites that employ geolocation to target local customers, and sites that specialize in video content and even news. <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yoast&#8217;s premium offerings cater to all these SEO requirements as well<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"social-sharing-plugins\" class=\"post-section\">Social Media Sharing<\/h2>\n<p>Making your content worthy of merit is good.

Every time someone visits your site, requests go to a database that holds your content. Accessing data from a database is time-consuming and loads your servers. You can reduce both the load time and the server load by using a caching plugin.<\/p>\n<p>A caching plugin essentially transforms your dynamic site into a static one. And this in effect, makes your site faster. When a caching plugin is fully operational, it does significantly affect your site&#8217;s performance.<\/p>\n<p>Your site&#8217;s performance is crucial to a good visitor experience. Slow websites make for terrible user experiences. Apart from that, your site&#8217;s performance is factored into search algorithms, and they reward speed.<\/p>\n<h3>WP Super Cache<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22938\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/WpSuperCacheHeader.png\" alt=\"WpSuperCache\" width=\"800\" height=\"258\"><\/p>\n<p>I like this plugin a lot, it caters to the needs of the tech savvy and those who aren&#8217;t as comfortable with WordPress. But it certainly does not sacrifice performance.<\/p>\n<p>It produces supercached files (served by PHP) which is one of the fastest caching methods you could hope to use.<\/p>\n<p>Caching files involves creating a new copy of the same files and too many files can end up having an effect opposite to speeding up your site. The plugin also regularly deletes the redundant copies of your site&#8217;s files.<\/p>\n<p>For many more options with caching plugins and a review in greater depth about them, read our detailed <a href=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/make-your-website-faster-top-wordpress-caching-plugins\/\">WordPress caching plugin guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a class=\"nectar-button medium accent-color\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-super-cache\/\">More info \/ Download<\/a>\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-contact-forms\" class=\"post-section\">Contact Forms<\/h2>\n<p>A contact form is means of communication between the web admin and the reader or a potential investor or new business partner.

It is especially important for business-oriented, revenue-generating websites.<\/p>\n<h3>Contact Form 7<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25223\" src=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/Contact-Form-7.png\" alt=\"Contact Form 7\" width=\"800\" height=\"257\"><\/p>\n<p>A simple way to add Contact Forms.
